WORK IN PROGRESS.

A simple calculator to help quickly build Combat Scenes in the Cosmere RPG by Brotherwise Games.

Simply run the main program and follow the instructions, the tool will calculate the possible combinations of enemy types to match the correct Threat level. This is just a guideline, tune the result to your party!

Current issues (will be fixed as I continue work on this project):
Can't calculate Bosses
Breaks above tier 1 (both party and adversary calculation)
Breaks (but slightly less) when Threat is X.5
